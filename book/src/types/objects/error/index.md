Error handling
==============

Error handling in [GraphQL] can be done in multiple ways. We will cover the two different error handling models mostly used: 
1. [Implicit field results](field.md). 
2. [Explicit errors backend by GraphQL schema](schema.md). 

Choosing the right error handling method depends on the requirements of the application and the concrete error happening. Investigating both approaches is beneficial.
